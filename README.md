###Coursera-GettingAndCleaningData
===============================

The course project is based on the following Samsung data for wearable tech:
https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip 

####This repository includes: 
* The code for creating a tidy data set: run_analysis.R 
* A codebook describing the variables.

####run_analysis.R does the following:
* Merges the training and test sets to create one data set.
* Filters to only the measurements of the mean and standard deviation for each variable, based on variables with mean() and variable()
* Uses descriptive activity names for each activity in the data set
* Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names.
* Creates a tidy data set with the average of each variable (from the mean and standard deviation filter) for each activity and subject.

The code assumes the data is in your working directory.
